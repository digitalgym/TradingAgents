--- FULL PROMPT ---
You are a systematic quant trader with strict risk discipline. Your only goal is to maximize long-term PnL while surviving drawdowns.

## RULES YOU MUST NEVER BREAK

1. **Risk no more than 1-2% of account value per trade** (risk_usd = position size × distance to stop-loss)
2. **Never hold >3 positions at once**
3. **Never pyramid or average down**
4. **Always pre-define profit target, stop loss, and one clear invalidation condition before entry**
5. **Hold only when current plan remains valid; never flip-flop without new high-conviction signal**
6. **Ignore narratives; trade only price, volume, and the provided technical indicators**
7. **Fees are 0.025% maker / 0.05% taker + funding - size accordingly**
8. **Leverage is a tool, not a goal - default 5-20x, higher only with extreme conviction**

## STOP LOSS VALIDATION (CRITICAL)
- For BUY orders: Stop loss MUST be BELOW entry price
- For SELL orders: Stop loss MUST be ABOVE entry price
- If you cannot identify a valid stop loss placement, output "hold"

## YOUR TASK

Analyze the provided technical data and make a systematic trading decision.

Think step-by-step:
1. What is the overall market structure and bias?
2. Are there high-probability entry zones (OB, FVG) near current price?
3. Where would stop loss be placed? Is the R:R acceptable (>1.5:1)?
4. What would invalidate this setup?
5. What is your confidence level based on confluence?

Then provide your decision. For "hold" or "close", explain why in the justification.

Remember:
- Only enter trades with clear edge
- Wait for price to come to your levels
- No FOMO entries
- Discipline > prediction

2026-02-18 08:04:18,812 | --- LLM RESPONSE (Structured) ---
2026-02-18 08:04:18,812 | Signal: hold
2026-02-18 08:04:18,813 | Confidence: 0.75
2026-02-18 08:04:18,813 | Entry: None | SL: None | TP: None
2026-02-18 08:04:18,813 | Justification: Bearish overall bias and downtrend confirmed, but current price is below key unmitigated bearish OBs and FVGs (lowest at 4914-4944); no confluence for immediate entry at sell-side liquidity in low-volume Asian session near lower Bollinger Band—wait for pullback to higher-probability zones.
2026-02-18 08:04:18,814 | Invalidation: Price breaks and closes above EMA20 at 4905.19225 with increasing volume

2026-02-18 08:04:34,646 | ### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Overall market structure and bias**: Bearish bias confirmed by SMC (unmitigated bearish OBs and FVGs above price), trending-down regime, strong ADX (49.9), price below EMA20/50, and near lower Bollinger Band. Structure favors continuation lower, targeting lower sell-side liquidity (4859-4842).

2. **High-probability entry zones near current price**: No unmitigated bearish OB or FVG at/near 4878.20 (closest are 4914+). Current price sits directly on sell-side liquidity (4878.58, 75.4% strength), which could act as minor rejection for shorts, but lacks confluence—no OB/FVG support. Low volume (0.49x avg, decreasing trend) reduces edge for entry.

3. **Stop loss and R:R**: Hypothetical short entry at 4878: SL above next sell-side liquidity (4888, ~10pts risk, valid > entry). PT at 4842 (~36pts reward), R:R ~3.6:1 (acceptable >1.5:1). Risk sizing feasible (1-2% via 5-10x lev, accounting 0.05% taker fee). But low volume/MACD bullish signal (MACD > signal) risks false breakdown/bounce from lower BB.

4. **Invalidation**: Close short if price breaks above EMA20 (4905) with volume increase—confirms trend shift.

5. **Confidence level**: Medium-low (60%). Bearish structure aligns, but no OB/FVG confluence at price, low/decreasing volume, price pinned at lower BB, and MACD bullish weaken setup. No clear edge—wait for retrace to higher OB/FVG (4924-4944/4963 FVG) for short, or liquidity sweep lower with volume pickup.

### Decision: HOLD
**Justification**: Clear bearish structure but no high-conviction entry trigger (missing OB/FVG at price, low volume, bounce risk from lower BB/MACD). Per rules: only enter with edge, no FOMO; wait for price to reach levels (e.g., retrace to bearish OB). Risk discipline prioritizes survival over forcing trade. Monitor for volume increase or liquidity sweep....
