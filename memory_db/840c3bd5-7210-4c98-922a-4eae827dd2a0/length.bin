🔔 PULLBACK ALERT - PROTECT YOUR LONG POSITIONS!
        
When a pullback or correction is signaled:
1. Set trailing stops on profitable longs
2. Consider taking partial profits (50%) at key resistance
3. Place limit sell orders at current levels to lock in gains
4. Don't hold through the entire pullback hoping it reverses

Remember: A profit taken is better than a profit lost waiting for more.r
