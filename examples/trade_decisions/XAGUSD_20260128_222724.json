  "rationale": "[Market Entry] Siding decisively with the BUY recommendation from the Trader's plan and Risky/Neutral analysts, as the structural bull case\u201417% supply deficits, 50% industrial demand from solar/EVs, multi-TF bullish SMC (unmitigated OBs/FVGs, price above key MAs)\u2014outweighs short-term exhaustion signals, echoing XAUUSD lessons where 'overbought RSI' and similar noise didn't halt upside when fundamentals aligned ('technical momentum as core driver'). Risky's 'multi-timeframe bullish powerhouse' and '70% win rate on FVG dip-buys' align with trader's scaled entry for averaging ~110.50, countering Safe's 'MACD divergence screaming retrace' by noting RSI neutral (56.89, no divergence) and sentiment 70-80% bullish on dips (r/WallStreetSilver). Neutral's balanced scaling (20% now, adds on dips, avg ~111) refines aggression with prudence. Refine trader's plan per past lessons: phased entry avoids chasing tops (XAUUSD improvement: 'reduce initial on overbought'), tight initial SL 108.55 (below FVG, ~1.8% from avg entry, 1-1.5% portfolio risk), tiered TPs lock gains early ('tighten partial exits'), trail post-TP1, monitor news/sentiment (geopolitics, China data). Dynamic trailing per XAUUSD ('trailing stop 50% ATR'). R:R 2.31+ favors upside, not Hold\u2014pullback risks are buy opportunities in uptrend.",
