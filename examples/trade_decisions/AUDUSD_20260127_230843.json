  "rationale": "[Market Entry] The debate reveals strong short-term bearish confluence on 1H (3 unmitigated OBs, 2 CHoCHs, ADX 47 with -DI dominance, MACD negative expansion, upper BB rejection at 0.69525, VWMA weak rallies) favoring SELL, as per Trader's plan, Risky ('1H bearish dominance... magnet pull to 0.69 FVG... 70/30 probability edge'), and Neutral ('1H structure screams rejection... high-probability 1H pull to 0.69 FVG'). Safe's PASS ignores this tactical edge ('overly timid when 1H structure screams rejection'), overemphasizing D1 OB defense and bullish FVGs which act as downside targets first. Multi-TF tension acknowledged, but lower TFs dictate entry; higher TF bulls (D1 above 200 SMA 0.66265, RSI divergence) provide buffer but not invalidation yet. Refined plan adopts Neutral's moderated SL at 0.7010 (68 pips risk vs Trader's 58, beyond psych 0.7000/ATR buffer to avoid hunts), TP1 0.6900 (42 pips, 50% scale 1:0.6 but quick win), TP2 0.6870 (~70 pips remainder, blended 1:1.2 R:R), reduced risk to 0.75% vs Trader's 1%. No past lessons to apply. Decisive SELL on bearish confirmation (rejection candle), trail post-TP1.",
