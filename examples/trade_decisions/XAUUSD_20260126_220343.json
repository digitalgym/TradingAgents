  "rationale": "[Limit/Pullback Entry] The debate reveals a strong bullish case from Risky Analyst, emphasizing the secular uptrend with 'central bank hoarding (730t YTD), ETF inflows for five straight months, and Goldman Sachs slapping a $2900 target for 2025', alongside technicals like 'D1 and 1H bullish BOS, ADX at 43.63 (+DI crushing -DI), MACD histogram expanding at +3.78, and 11 unmitigated FVGs pulling price up'. This aligns with the Trader's plan to buy dips to 5052-5067, noting 'D1 confluence wins 80% of the time historically'. Safe Analyst counters effectively with short-term risks: '4H bearish CHOC signaling potential distribution, nearest FVG support at 4989.72-5052.34', 'hot CPI (2.4% y/y), rising yields at 4.1%', and lack of OBs, advocating PASS or wait for confirmation. Neutral Analyst provides balance: 'Enter limit on confirmed dip to 5052-5067 1H FVG... SL at 4980... TPs at 5140 and 5200', capturing '70% bull prob growth while hedging 30% retrace'. Weighing these, the macro/HTF bullish fortress (price +131 above 50 SMA, RSI 65 cooling for extension) outweighs 4H noise, especially at broker price 5089.87 near key support. Refine Trader's plan to BUY on dip to 1H FVG zone (midpoint 5059.5 for optimal entry), tight SL at 5038 (below FVG/1x ATR as per Trader/Risky, ~21.5 pt risk), TPs scaling at 5140 (1H FVG/BOS) and 5200 (D1 proj). This yields superior 3.74:1 RR on TP1 vs Trader's market entry ~1:1, with standard 1% risk, 3-7 day hold, exit on 4H close below 5052. Decisive BUY as HTF edge clear, no deadlock.",
