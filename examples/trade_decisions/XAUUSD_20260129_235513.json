  "action": "BUY",
  "rationale": "[Limit/Pullback Entry] The debate shows strong consensus for a BUY direction, aligning with the trader's original plan and past lessons from successful dip-buy in uptrends (Jan 2026 BUY +8.78%: rode geo catalysts and technical momentum above SMAs despite overbought RSI; opposite of failed SELL -5.92%: over-relied on RSI without reversal confirmation, underrated CB demand). Risky's aggressive scaling captures SMC confluences ('2 unmitigated OBs, 5-8 FVGs, BOS intact, RSI 34.79 oversold rocket fuel'), Neutral refines for balance ('30% now, add on confirmation, 2.5:1 R:R'), Safe cautions risks but doesn't overturn bullish structure. Current setup mirrors winning trade: oversold RSI (34.79 vs prior 78.29), D1 above 200 SMA, post-NFP dip held FVG (5504-5520), CB 1100t YTD + geo tailwinds overriding USD noise (per Goldman $2900+). Refine plan: enter primarily at broker 5520.04000 with reduced size (0.75-1% portfolio risk max), scale modestly to 5504/5417 if holds; tight SL 5377 (consensus institutional invalidation beyond 5417 FVG per ATR 39.99, honors Co Fundamentals 'beyond zones'); tiered TPs lock profits early. Avoid past errors: multiple confirmations (no bear CHoCH), weight CB/inflation/geo heavily. 65-75% bounce odds per report/base case.",
