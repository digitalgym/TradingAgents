  "rationale": "[Limit/Pullback Entry] Siding with the HTF bullish bias emphasized by Risky and refined by Neutral, overriding Safe's excessive caution, as past lessons (+8.78% BUY success vs. -5.92% failed SELL) teach avoiding counter-trend shorts without multi-TF confirmation. Risky nails 'HTF bullish bias crushes 1H noise\u2014price +7.7% above 200 SMA with golden cross holding,' with 6-7 unmitigated FVGs as magnets to 5300+. Neutral tempers wisely: 'balanced play... SL at 5210 (just beyond 4H FVG/1 ATR, -0.8% risk),' avoiding Safe's 'SL at 5218... prime for liquidity hunts' and trader's tight 5218. Counter Safe: 1H CHOC/MACD bearish is 'short-term distribution' (Neutral), not trend break\u2014price anchors at 4H FVG 5225, RSI 34.79 nearing oversold signals snapback per BB pierce. Refine trader's plan: 30% entry now at 5253 (broker price), scale 40% at 5225 FVG hold/higher low, reserve 30% for 5200 test; trail SL to breakeven at 5275 (pre-5280), then 1.5x ATR (~60pts); TPs scaled 25% each at 5300/5333, trail rest to 5350+ on BOS. Reduced 4-5% exposure honors Safe's asset protection while capturing Risky's upside (1:1.5+ RR avg). Fundamentals (CB 730t, Fed 59% cuts, geo risks) and 85% bull sentiment outweigh NFP/USD noise, per world affairs/social reports\u2014no HOLD, as HTF firepower demands action like prior win's phased entries/dynamic stops.",
