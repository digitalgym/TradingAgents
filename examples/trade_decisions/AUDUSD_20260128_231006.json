  "action": "SELL",
  "rationale": "[Market Entry] The SELL recommendation aligns with the trader's original plan and is strongly supported by Safe Analyst's emphasis on confirmed downtrend strength (ADX 45.91, -DI 32.33 >> +DI 8.07, price below 50 SMA 0.67457/10 EMA 0.67407/VWMA 0.67934, bearish MACD crossover) and macro tailwinds (NFP 254k driving DXY to 102.69, iron ore -33% YTD, USD safe-haven flows), outweighing Risky's SMC bullish zones (OBs/FVGs at 0.70) and RSI 36.89 divergence without +DI flip or BOS confirmation. Neutral's conservative BUY ignores short-term seller dominance and NFP override, risking whipsaw like XAUUSD failed SELL where overbought signals lacked momentum confirmation\u2014here, bear momentum is intact, echoing lesson to avoid fading trends (XAUUSD success rewarded trend alignment). Refinements keep trader's tight SL 0.7020 (ATR 1x ~27 pips above highs), TP1 0.6980 (OB break, 30% close), TP2 0.6900 (D1 support, 40% close), scaling 50% now/50% above 0.7015, 1% risk capped at 3% total, trail post-TP1. R:R ~3.5:1 average (27 pips risk to blended TPs). Decisive SELL over HOLD as downside skew 60-70% per debate/data.",
